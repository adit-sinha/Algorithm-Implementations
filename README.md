# Search-Algorithm-Implementations
This project involves implementation of several pathfinding algorithms and local search algorithms in Python. Many thanks to Dr. Levi Lelis and his team for providing guidance for these implementations.

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Conflict-Based Search (Multi-Agent Pathfinding)
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. A* Algorithm

## Local Search Algorithms:
1. Hill Climbing
2. Hill Climbing with Restarts
